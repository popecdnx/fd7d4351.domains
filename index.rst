.. The 'self' entry ensures the current page (index.rst) is included in the TOC.
.. Replace 'installation', 'usage', 'api', 'contributing', and 'about' with the
   actual filenames (without the .rst extension) of your other documentation pages.
   Ensure these files exist in the same directory or a subdirectory.
